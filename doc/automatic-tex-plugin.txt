If you found this plugin useful or you have any kind of problems with running
it or some ideas to share, you are cordially invited to write to me:
mszamot@gmail.com. Voting at Vim site is also welcome ;) .

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
					Abstract

This is a filetype plugin for Vim to comfortably write TeX (LaTeX, PdfLaTeX)
documents, which provides functionality not met in other such plugins. It
makes you FREE from compiling procedure, making this process automatic using
autocommands. It also provides useful mappings and other functions: to analyse
your .log file, to see the table contents, to search for a label, to search in
bib files or to find a macro definition matching a pattern, or even to find
and preview fonts in your tex distribution. The features include an extended
tab completion for: commands, environment names, packages, input files, bib
files, bst files, colors, closing brackets and environments (preserves
nesting),... etc. To have full functionality you need: pdffonts available in
the package 'app-text/poppler' (at least in Gentoo). Another good tool is
texdoc, which is a part of texlive - these days standard TeX distribution for
Linux, and MikTeX on Windows.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES INCLUDE:
-----------------
* background compilation with debugging mode 
* command to make the document (cross references, references, index, tables
  of contents) |atp-:MakeLatex|,
* completion for commands, closing environments (even nested), package names,
  citations and labels. Support for some latex packages.
	See |atp-Completion|, 
* table of contents which allows to switch between different sections, files, 
  but also to delete and paste sections:
	See |atp-:TOC|,
* list of labels which allows to see the context of a label:
	See |atp-:Labels|,
* a powerful function to search in bibliographic files (bib files):
	See |atp-bibsearch|,
* a command to list ToDo lines:
	See |atp-:ToDo|.
* a command to search for a macro definition (multi-line support):
 	See |atp-:DefiSearch|
* a command to search and PREVIEW fonts in your latex distribution:
 	See |atp-:FontSearch|, and |atp-:FontPreview|
* indentation

NEWS							*atp-news*

	Changes in version 7.4

	:TexAlign
	map \a 
<	This is a wraper around Align command (AutoAlign vim plugin:
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=884). This command
	sets correct align options for LaTeX environments: equation, align,
	alignat, flalign, displaymath and tabular. Equation, align, alignat,
	flalign and displaymath are checked using syntax, tabular environment
	is checked using searchpair() function, the g:atp_completion_limits[2]
	applies.

>
	:TeXdoc -> :TexDoc
<	still under <F1>.

>
	:NSSec, :NSec, :NChap, :NPart
	:PSSec, :PSec, :PChap, :PPart
<	Are using now the atp search function |atp-:S|. This only takes
	a difference in project files.

 	vmaps has changed: >
	is -> iS
	as -> aS
<	This is because there are vim commands is and as (inner/outer
	sentence). iS/aS = inner/outer syntax area.
	
< 	History feature reviewed:
>
	HISTORY FILE
<	The directory ftplugin/ATP_files/history under your 'runtimepath'
	stores fiels with values of local variables saved before vim leaved
	a buffer (it is versy simlar to |View|. Local and global variables are
	supported. The local variables
	which are cached in this way are listed in >
		let g:atp_cached_local_variables = [
		\ 'atp_MainFile', 		'atp_History',
		\ 'atp_LocalCommands', 		'atp_LocalColors',
		\ 'atp_LocalEnvironments', 	'TreeOfFiles', 
		\ 'ListOfFiles', 		'TypeDict', 
		\ 'LevelDict']
<	The each file will have seprate history file which stores the values
	of these variables.

	There is also common history file, which stores values of global
	variables (by default it is ftplugin/ATP_files/history/common_var.vim
	The global variables that are written in this file are given in vim
	list: >
	    let g:atp_cached_common_variables = [
	    \ 'atp_texpackages', 	'atp_texclasses' ]
<

	If you want to disable this feature for some reason you can set >
		let g:atp_History = 0
<	or >
		let b:atp_History = 0
<	If you want to disable this feature only for a given buffer. 
	(The value of local variable overrides the value of global one!). 

	In your .vimrc file (it will not work when put in atprc file).
	There are these commands: >
		:LoadHistory[!]
		:WriteHistory[!]
		:DeleteHistory[!] [local/common]
		:History[!] [on/off]
<	which do the obvious thing (unless g:atp_History=0 or b:atp_History=0). 
	:DeleteHistory [local] command (with optinal argument [local]) deletes
	the history file for the current buffer (only the local one), with
	bang "!" it deletes also common history file. The bang of WriteHistory
	forces to write to history file even when history is turend off
	(g:atp_History=0 or b:atp_History=0).

	The command ':History on/off' turns on/off History feature for this
	buffer (sets b:atp_History). With bang it also sets the global
	variable. b:atp_History is by default in the >
	    g:atp_cached_local_variables 
<	so it will be restored afterwards. b:atp_History if defined overrides
	the value of global variable g:atp_History. So you can set in your atp
	file g:atp_History = 0 and for some files using the if-construction: >
		let g:atp_History = 0
		if expand("%:t") == "myfile.tex"
		    let b:atp_History = 1
		endif
<	will turn on the History feature only for myfile.tex. Something more
	elaborate would be to set b:atp_History only for files with
	modification time less than two days for example.

	Note: If you delete the history file for the current buffer it will be
	written after exiting vim, unless you turn off the hisory feature.

	The history is disabled for files which fullpath matches 'texmf',
	which should not be statically related to any file. The optional bang
	loads history also for them. :WriteHistory command will write
	the history disregarding if the file is under texmf directory or not.

	Note: If you use this feature, you might need to use some times the
	commads: |atp-:LocalCommands| and |atp-:InputFiles| which will update
	b:atp_LocalCommands, b:atp_LocalColors, b:atp_LocalEnvironments and 
	b:TreeOfFiles, b:ListOfFiles, b:TypeDict and b:LevelDict. Then use
	these commands with a bang "!" (:LocalCommands!, :InputFiles!). The
	second set of variables is also updated by |atp-:S| (also with "!"a
	and GotoFile.

	Note: Also when you add a package to tex you should remove the common
	history file, so that the new packages will be added to complation
	list. 

	The history directory is configurable via the variable: >
		let g:atp_history_dir
<	The default value is 'ftplugin/ATP_files/history'.

>
	Changes in version 7.3.7
<	Numerous Fixes +
	Notification Highlight:
		the status message 'LaTeX' ( if you use latex, 'pdfLaTeX') can
		be highlighted. There are several variables to set this: >
		g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_gui
		g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_guifg
		g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_guibg

		g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_cterm
		g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_ctermfg
		g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_ctermbg

<	where g:colors_name is the name of the color scheme, for example the
	supplied color scheme with atp 'runtimepath/colors/coots-beauty-256'
	has name 'coots_beauty_256' so the first variable should be >
		g:atp_highlight_coots_beauty_256_gui
<	value of these variables are used to set highlight for the group UserN
	where N is the value of g:atp_statusNotifHi. Its value should be
	0,1,...,9. Where 0 means no highlight for status notification (which
	is the default). If it is set to positive value then the default
	values of these variables should give the same color as the status
	line has.

	The variable g:atp_StatusLine is stores the value of vim option
	'statusline'; actually 'statusline' option is set by:
			set statusline=%!g:atp_StatusLine
>
	Changes in version 7.3.4 and 7.3.6 
<				(in 7.3.6 I added :DeleteHistory[!] [file], see below.)
>
	:DefiSearch[!] [pattern]
<		With bang it searches whole file, without only preambule (and
		files included in the preambule). Pattern is any vim pattern.
		(The difference is that the command uses <q-args> (:h
		<q-args>).
>
	b:atp_running
<	This variable stor the current number of running instances of latex.
	When it is greater than 1 a message in the status line is shown. If :PID
	command returns that no latex is running this variable this variable
	is reset to 0. 
>
	map: vip, vap (vmap: ip, ap)
<	ip - inner paragraph
			from the nearest \begin:\end:\par or empty line to the
			nearest \begin:\end:\par or empty line 
	ap - outer paragraph
			from the nearest \par or empty line to the nearest
			empty line. 
	i) a) removed - the vim original functions are better.
>
	nmap: gw
<	Quite useful normal map: m`vipgq``. It is mapped to gw (in normal
	mode).
>
	nmap: g>, g<, 2g>, ..., 6g>  
<	A normal map to m`vipg>`` (or m`vip2g>``).

	New variable: >
		g:atp_sort_completion_list	= 12
<	If the length of completion list for Tab Completion is longer than
	this value, entries will be sorted alphabetically, else they are
	provided in, I hope, useful order. If set to 0 the list will not be
	sorted (if set to 1 it will be always sorted).

	Tab Completion is now working in project files (tab completion
	checks for packages defined in the preambule of the main file). 
>
	nmap gf, :GotoFile, :EditInputFile
<	a command which behaves like 'gf' was added. With the minor
	difference, it always gives the choice which input file to edit,
	regardless of the position of the cursor.

	The current file is now also shown, with highlight group: |hl-WarningMsg|. 

    :S[!] /{pattern}/ [flag]
	Now, it sets the alternate file to the buffer from which the search begun.
	This means that if {pattern} was found the alternate file before search
	will be lost. It gives a handy way to come back after a search.

	The pattern can be '\\input'. Then it goes recursively to the first
	input line. 
	
	Now it also doesn't search inside commented input files. There two
	commands: >
	:NInput
	:PInput
<	and two mappings: >
	]gf
	[gf
<	which finds the next/previous input line (also commented). See
	|atp-:S_input| to find how it works.

    :BibSearch [pattern] [flag]
	Lines of bib file are matched against the pattern. Before the match
	are ligature symbols and {,} are removed. For example  \`a, \' e,
	\oa,\ea are substituted with a, e, oa, ea (respectively). Note that
	the space in \' e is also removed.
						
    :Viewer						*atp-:Viewer*
    	Command which help to set b:atp_Viewer variable (with completion)
    :Compiler						*atp-:Compiler*
    	Command which help to set b:atp_TexCompiler variable (with completion)
    :DebugMode						*atp-:DebugMode*
    	Command which help to set b:atp_DebugMode variable (with completion)
>
	New Features in version 7.3.1 (some changes after version 7.3)
<	
	Some things works faster in this version: generating the lables and
	recursive looking for input files (using vimgrep). 

	:GotoFile, :EditInputFile
	nmap gf
			To go to file over a cursor or it let choose an input 
			file from the list. Over: 
			    \input{<fname>}, \input <fname>, \include{<fname>}
			it edits the <fname>
			If g:atp_developer is set to one also works over:
			    \documentclass{<classname>}, \usepakcage{<packagename} 
			Otherwise, i.e if the cursor position is not over any
			of the above it lets you choose which input file to
			use.  

			The current file is now shown with highlight group:
			|hl-WarningMsg|. 
			
	:MakeLatex[!]						|atp-:MakeLatex|
			With one command you can make your whole document:
			cross references, bibliography, index, table of
			contents. ':MakeLatex!' should be used when you
			deleted an entry from bibliography (when you use
			'bibtex' this means when you deleted last citation
			command with the entry).
>								*atp-:S*
	:S[!] /{pattern}/ [flags]
			Changes after version 7.3: The E and S flags are
			removed. The pattern is a vim pattern (with
			'magic'). With bang ! it regenerates the tree
			of input files.

			This is command does the same job as |/| but is
			recursive in the tree of files (so it is useful only
			in project files). The syntax of this command is
			similar to |:vimgrep|. 

			This works similarly to |:ijump|. But also goes back
			to the root file (b:atp_MainFile).

			It sets the alternate file to the buffer from which
			the search begun. That means if no search was found
			the alternate file before search will be lost.

			The {pattern} is any vim pattern as desribed in
			|pattern| (it was only tested with 'magic' set on).
			
			The supported flags are 'bcewW' (see |search()|). 

			You can enclose the pattern with any non-ID character
			(see |'isident'|) instead of /, as far as it does not
			appear in the {pattern}. Examples: >
				:S pattern\_swith\_sspaces
<			will work but: >
				:S pattern with spaces
<			will not.		

			There is a new function to check where the input file
			is on the hard drive if the name in the input command
			doesn't inlcude the full path. It asks kpsewhich which
			directories to search, filters out some directories
			(which are not under '/home', I assume that there is
			your local texmf tree, and also directories which name
			contains one of the two keywords 'texlive' and
			'kpsewhich'). This makes the searching faster. 
								*atp-:S_input*
			Furthermore, the command is designed so that it can find
			all patterns '\\input' (and thus easily find next/previous
			input file). You can use: >
				:S \\input
				:S \\input b 
<			and you can use 'n' and 'N' vim normal commands. Note
			that it if you go backward, then it means that it will
			find the most deep line, e.g.: >
				file.tex
					----
					----
					\input{file.1} ---->  -------
							      -------
							      \input{file.1.1}
							      -------
			                ----X	 			      
<			':S /\\input/ b' in the X position fill find
			\input{file.1.1} assuming file.1.1.tex doesn't inputs
			any other file. 
								*atp-:ToggleNn*  >
	:ToggleNn		
<			Switches on/off them nmaps n,N to the recursive
			search. If these maps are defined n and N use
			recursive search. 

	Mappings are defined with nore (':h noremap') so they work even when
	the Special Space map is on (see |atp-:ToggleSpace|)
>
	New Features in version 7.2.1
	New Features in TOC
<			Using ':DeleteSection' you can delete the section
			under cursor together with all its subsections.
			/Section can be one of: part, chapter, section,
			subsection, subsubsection, or bibliography/.  Deleted
			section will be added to a stack which can be shown
			using the command ':SectionStack' There is a command
			to paste the section from section stack
			':PasteSection'. By default it pastes the most recent
			element in the stack.  Passing a number will paste
			that element of the stack /bear in mind that then
			numbers of sections in the stack will change/.

				':PasteSection' pusts the section just before
				where next section starts.

			Note: If you use bibtex commands to make
			bibliography ATP finds the line which contains
			'\bibliography' command. And then searches backward
			for the first line which is a blank line. The next
			line is assumed to be the first line of bibliography.
			Thus to move the last section before bibliography or
			the bibliography itself its better you put a blank
			line before bibliography commands.  The same applies
			for bibliographies put in the middle of document (end
			of a chapter, part, etc.) The end of bibliography is
			found in the same way as the end of subsubsection.  If
			you use \begin{thebibliography}:\end{thebibliography}
			there is no such a problem.

			If you want to paste a section before the first
			section, use the line with the file name. >
 		:Undo, nnoremap u, nnoremap U, nnoremap g-, nnoremap g+ 
<			You can use undo. The :Undo command will undo in the
			buffer under the cursor (it simly switches to the
			correct window, usese the vim undo function, and runs
			:TOC command - so after all your back in ToC.). The
			':Undo' command has one argument - the vim undo
			command to use, it is one of: 'u/U/g-/g+' (the default
			is 'u'). They are mapped to 'u','U', 'g-' and 'g+'.
			(only in the ToC buffer).  Note: ':Undo' command
			doesn't changes the Section Stack.

			There is one more level of security: There is a global
			variable which stores all the deleted sections
			together with some information about them: >
					g:atp_SectionBackup
<			it is a vim list (see |List|). Each entry is a list of
			the following format: >
			[ <title>, <type>, <deleted_section>, <section_nr>, <file> ]
<			where <title> is the section title, <type> is one of:
			part, chapter, section, subsection, subsubsection
			bibliography or abstract.  Deleted section is a list
			of deleted lines, <section_nr> is the number of the
			section that it had before deletetion, <file> is the
			full path to the file which it comes from.  If you
			need to use it, you can use the vim function
			|append()| to put the <deleted_section> in the right
			place.

		    NOTE:
			You may want to have a map: >
					:au FileType toc_atp nnoremap dd :DeleteSection<CR>
<			this can be put in your '$HOME/.atp.vim' configuration 
			file.	
>
	Tab Completion for Labels
<			Tab Completion for labels (|atp-completion|)
			allows to specify the number of the counter, e.g. >
					\ref{3.1<Tab>
<			will complete into the label of the counter with value
			'3.1'. As for now you can not specify which counter to
			complete.  You can also write '\ref{3.1$' the part
			'3.1$' is used as a pattern!

			Also the window with labels has changed, it shows the
			label number, label name, and the line number where is
			was defined.  

			For this two work you there must be aux file.  As for
			now the aux file if it is not present is not made.

			This is working with the main document classes:
			article, book, review, amsart, amsbook, memoir. If for
			some class it is not working thanks for reporting me
			(it's enough to email me just the document class). 
>
	$HOME/.atprc.vim					*atp-atprc*
<			A configuration file for ATP. Now you do not have to
			use autocommands to set local-buffer options, just
			place them here.
>
	call back/debug mode	
<			|atp-debug-mode| This was rewritten so you should read
			it! There are NEW FEATURES !!!  Note: you need use
			gvim or >
					vim --servername VIM
<			for this.   
>
	b:atp_TexFlavour	
<			if you are editing a plain tex file it is automatically 
			set to 'plaintex', then you get highlighting for
			$$:$$. Some other features are planned (you can also
			set this while editing a 'tex' file, i.e. latex
			document but using $$:$$ is latex is not recommended
			it is know to break some latex specific things).
>
	New Features in version 7.1
	g:atp_MathVimOptions	= { 'textwidth' : '0' }
<			This variable is a dictionary of vim settings and its
			values which will be valid when you edit mathematics
			inside the pairs \(:\), $:$, \[:\], $$:$$ (only in
			plain tex files or if g:atp_TexFlavour = 'plaintex').
			For example, the default value will toggle between
			your 'textwidth' in non-math and 0 in math.  The
			dictionary may contain short option names equally well
			as long names.

			Note: the standard tex syntax file defines other
			zones: for example for align and equation environments
			(and many others) but some how they are not accessible
			using synstack() function. 
			
			This feature can be turned off using setting variable >
					g:atp_SetMathVimOptions
<			to '0', the default is '1'.

INSTALLATION                               		*atp-installation*
>
	 :filetype plugin on is required to run this plugin, see
	 |:filetype-plugin-on| and |:filetype-indent-on| if you want to have
	 automatic indentation for TeX files. Also |:syntax on| is required as
	 several features (but not basic ones) requieres syntax.
<
To install you just need to copy tex.Vim file to ~your ~/.Vim/ftplugin/
directory copy this help file to ~/.Vim/doc and then run :helptags ~/.Vim/doc
and that's all, now you can just type your story ... :)

If you do not like colors you can still set syntax on but clear the highlight
colors (you should make a simple function which clears all the highlight
groups, because ':hi clear' will not give you what you want).


================================================================================
COMMANDS	                               		*atp-commands* *atp-:*
							

The main function is not seen by the user (it is called s:compiler, for those
who want to read the plugin). It executes tex compiler specified by the
variable b:atp_TexCompiler. It is executed
as an autocommand by the line:
	au! CursorHold $HOME*.tex silent call 's:auTeX()'
where s:auTeX() is a simple function which calls s:compiler if the file written
on the disk and the buffer differ.
As you can see it will run if a key is not pressed during time defined by
option 'updatetime' (see |CursorHold|) in the normal mode. If you type in
insert mode the file won't be compiled (and that's alright as you can be in the
middle of your very long formula). The value of 'updatetime' which works fine
is around 1000ms ('updatetime' is set in milliseconds). Tex compiler is run with
one options:
	-output-directory 
which points to a unique temporary file in Vim temporary directory (using the
function 'tempname()' (see |tempname()|. If you are concerned with security
reasons read also: |shelltemp|.

You can switch off/on the function s:auTeX by pressing <S-F5> or by letting
the local to buffer variable b:autex=1 (on) b:autex=0 (off). It is useful in
some situations turn automatic compiling off. The key <S-F5> calls the function
ToggleAuTex() which sets the variable b:autex and issue a message. You can also
set this variable to 0 for some files that are not supposed to be processed,
for example:
>
	au BufRead texmf/*.tex let b:atp_autex=0
<
On start up b:atp_autex is set to 1 if the path of opened file is not under any
tex directory ('kpsewhich -show-path tex', except the current dir). For example,
files located under your local texmf tree will have b:atp_autex=0.

The second important variable b:atp_TexCompiler (see |atp-b:atp_TexCompiler|) configures
if you use TeX, PdfTeX, LaTeX, PdfLaTeX and it should point to the program
name so please do not use capital letters.

Next variable to set is b:atp_OutDir (see |atp-b:atp_OutDir|). It configures where TeX
will put the output and where viewer and log analyzing tools can find
appropriate files. 

The last top most important variable is |atp-g:keep| which is a list of extensions,
by default it is
	let g:keep = ["log","aux","toc","bbl"]
Files with this extension will be copied from b:atp_OutDir to the temporary
directory with appropriate name to be used when (La)TeX is compiling. (log file
will be only copied after it is created, other files will be copied back and
forth between you b:atp_OutDir and the temporary directory)

							|atp-callback|
							|atp-debug-mode|
	By default the call back mechanism is turned on (g:atp_callback=1)

	When call back mechanism is set, which is by default if you run gui
	version, if you invoke 'vim' from command line you need to add
	'servername' variable, it might be desirable to alias vim to to >
			vim --servername VIM 
< 	you have additional functionalities:

	* STATUS LINE NOTIFICATION: status line can show if tex is running >
		    let g:atp_status_notification = 1
<		If unset you will get a message when compiler ends.
		If set the number next to the name of your compiler indicates
		how many instances are currently running.
	* The LOG FILE will be automatically read after compilation.

	* if t:atp_DebugMode 	= 'silent'
			   You will not get any message from compilation. 

				= 'debug'
			   After the end of compilation (invoked by the user
			   or autocommand) you will get a message with the
			   return status of the compilator.

			   If you open the error window with :copen or with
			   the menu option ToggleDebugMode then it will be
			   automatically closed after first compilation with
			   exist status 0. 

			   	= 'verbose'
			   Every compilation which is invoked by the user will
			   be run in verbose mode as with <F5> key.

	Note: the 'verbose' mode in 'vim' (in console) needs to be run, when
	there is no other latex instance running. Now you get a message to
	wait until compilation ends. In future releases, a better solution
	will be worked out. Gui version 'gvim' works better (as it doesn't  
	suspend the editor).

	 The background compilation is always done in g:atp_DefaultDebugMode.
	 Unless it is set to 'verbose' in which case 'debug' mode is used. 

	 You can invoke compiler in the 'debug' mode with '<LocalLeader>d',
	 '<LocalLeader>l' uses the default mode.

						*atp-b:atp_ReloadOnError*
The variable b:atp_ReloadOnError if set to 1 (the default) reload the file
even when the exit status of compiler was non zero. If set to 0, then the file
will not be reloaded [actually for viewers other than xpdf it will not be
copied from the temporary directory, for xpdf it will be copied but not
reloaded). 

There is also a variable which stores the last command which executed
your tex compiler, see |atp-g:texcommand|.   

Below I explain commands (functions) which are accesible: 

:{runs}TEX [debug_mode]						*atp-:TEX*
map \l, map \d
	If anyway you want to run TeX yourself but you do not want to see the
	output this is the right tool. This runs TeX in 'nonstopmode'. You can
	specify an argument {runs} which tells how many consecutive runs of
	TeX you need (this is important if you want to compile Table of
	Contents, or index, or the bibliography (see |atp-:Bibtex|)

	If b:atp_OpenViewer=1 and there current viewer (b:Viewer) is not
	running on the output file then this function will open a viewer. By
	default b:atp_OpenViewer=0 and this feature is disabled. 

	The command :2TEX will call the compiler two times.

	It is useful when you want to make the outline (using hyperref
	package) of your article in pdf files, the tex file has to be
	'sourced' twice. To make the bibliography you can use |atp-:Bibtex|.

	If {runs} > 5 it will be reduced to 5, to avoid running tex for hundreds
	(or event thousands) of times (what could happen otherwise by
	a mistake giving the range of the command to be the current line
	number).

	The optional argument [debug_mode] has possible valus: '', 'silent',
	'debug', 'verbose'. When '' the value of g:atp_DefaultDebugMode is
	used. See the description of |atp-debug-mode|.

	\d is mapped to :TEX debug and \l to :TEX (thus it uses your default
	debug mode).

:DTEX 							*atp-:DTEX*
map <F5>,imap <F5> 
	This is equivalent to ':TEX debug'.

							*atp-:MakeLatex*
:MakeLatex[!]
	With one command you can make your whole document: cross references,
	bibliography (with or without bibtex), index, table of contents, table
	of figures, table of theorems ([ntheorem package]), table of
	algorithms. ':MakeLatex!' should be used when an entry from
	bibliography was deleted (when 'bibtex' is involved this is when you
	delete last citation command of a bib entry).

:ShowErrors [flag]					*atp-:ShowErrors*
	This command shows error/warning messages. It sets the |'errorformat'|
	variable accordingly to the optional [flag] argument, which is a word
	made of letters:
>
		e		- include errors
		w		- include all warning messages
		r		- include all reference warnings
		c		- include all citations warnings
		f		- include all font warnings
		fi		- include font info massages
		F		- show files listed in the log
				    (messages which start with 'File: ')
				    shows the files loaded by tex
					for example fd files that LaTeX is using
		p		- show packages loaded by tex 
				    (messages which start with 'Package: ')
		all		- show all the log file		    
		o		- open the log file in a new buffer (split).
<
	If none flag is given 'e' is used.  If 'o' flag is uesd the split
	buffer with log message has a map 'q' to ':bd'.  
	Example: >
		:ShowErrors rc
<	will show all reference and citation warnings.

ShowErrors maps:					*atp-:ShowErrors-maps* 

<F6>+e			to see all errors 	(:ShowErrors e)
<F6>+w			to see all warnings	(:ShowErrors w)
<F6>+r			to see warnings coming	(:ShowErrors rc) 
			from references or citations  
<F6>+f			to see font warnings 	(:ShowErrors f)

this is not a texloganalyzer mapping but it is a good place to mention it:
<F6>+l			to open log file in a new split window
			this is a mapping to the |atp-:OpenLog|.

:SetErrorFormat {flag} 					*atp-:SetErrorFormat*
	This command has the same syntax as :ShowErrors. It only sets the
	|'erroformat'| variable.
	
						 
:Bibtex[!] [debug_mode]					*atp-:Bibtex*
map \b
	This function will call bibtex to produce the bibliography file
	(.bbl). If in |atp-b:atp_OutDir| there is no 'aux' file it first calls tex
	compiler. After the 'bbl' file is produced two consecutive runs of tex
	compiler are called to make the bibliography.

	If you specify any value to the [debug_mode] option then then this function
	will be called in verbose mode (only the last time tex compiler will
	run in errorstop mode). This gives you the chance to see the output of
	bibtex command for a second. The command :Bibtex v is associated to
	this behaviour. If you want to just run bibtex see the next function.

	The command :Bibtex  will :call Bibtex(), while :Bibtex v
	(and :Bibtex [debug_mode]) will :call Bibtex(1)

	For the description of optional argument [debug_mode] see |atp-:TEX|.

							*atp-g:atp_raw_bibinputs*
	Tex is looking for the date base files in the path: `kpsewhich
	-show-path bib`. The variable g:atp_bibinputs contains
	these directories separated by commas. If atp cannot find your
	bib file, tex also won't be able. 
							*atp-g:atp_raw_texinputs*
	Similarly this variable stores all of path reported by `kpsewhich
	-show-path tex`.
							*atp-g:atp_bibinputs*
	This is a list of directories as g:atp_raw_bibinputs with appended '**' 
	see ':h file-searching'.
							*atp-g:atp_texinputs*
	This is a list of directories as g:atp_raw_texinputs with appended '**' 
	see ':h file-searching'.

:ViewOutput						*atp-:ViewOutput*
map \v,map <F3>, imap <F3>  
	You would like to see what you are editing use this function. It will
	use the program defined in the variable b:atp_Viewer. See |atp-b:atp_Viewer|,
	|atp-g:atp_XpdfServer|, |atp-xpdfOptions|. When there is no output file it will run
	TeX and open the file. Read more about particular viewers
	(inverse/reverse searching) in |atp-viewers|. 

:SetXdvi						*atp-:SetXdvi*
	This command sets the options for xdvi viewer, which enables inverse
	and reverse searching. It sets the command >
		:RevSearch
		map \rs
<	For inverse searching hold CTRL and click left mouse button on
	the text in xdvi viewer. 

:SetXpdf						*atp-:SetXpdf*
	This command sets the options for xpdf viewer (as for now the
	inverse/reverse searching in pdf files is not implemented)
	It will read the xpdf viewer options from the variables
	b:atp_xpdfOptions and g:atp_xpdfOptions.

							
:BibSearch [pattern] [flag]				see |atp-:BibSearch|
	This function finds bib entries in bib files defined in your tex file
	and in the variable b:atp_BibFiles (see |atp-b:atp_BibFiles|), which match the
	[pattern] (a vim regular expression). The output is configurable by
	the [flag] argument, see |atp-bibflags|.

:BibChoose						see |atp-:BibChoose|
map c, map y, map p
	This function is defined in the window with results of BibSearch
	command. It is mapped to 'y' and 'c' and let you copy the bib entry key
	to a register (see |atp-:BibChoose|) or directly to last opened
	buffer (after the last cursor position). When you chose to paste, it
	will close the BibSearch window.

						
:FindBibFiles						*atp-:FindBibFiles*
	This updates the variables s:bibfiles, s:allbibfiles,
	s:notreadablebibfiles. Finds all bib files defined in all
	'\bibliography' commands. For more about the above variables read
	|atp-variables-bib|. This function is called internally be the script
	functions BibSearch/BibChoose.  The command :FindBibFiles finds bib
	files in the current buffer. 

	If a readable bib file was not found under one of path listed in of
	g:atp_bibinputs variable (see |atp-g:atp_bibinputs|) it is classified
	as not readable.  

							
:GotoFile[!]						*atp-:GotoFile*
:EditInputFile[!]	/ the old name / 
nmap gf
	This command finds input files under b:atp_MainFile (it is recursive).  
	The nmap 'gf' cheks first if there is a file under the cursor.

	This command uses kpsewhich to find in which path to find input files.
	Actually the path: |atp-g:atp_texinputs| for input files and
	|atp-g:atp_bibinputs| for bib files are used. 

	The bibliographis declared are also listed. The command searches for
	them in any directory listed in g:atp_bibinputs (see
	|atp-g:atp_bibinputs|).

	If g:atp_developer = 1 (defualt 0) then the map 'gf' can also open
	package files and document class files.

	With bang "!" this command regenerates tree of files (this is
	important only in files with input lines), without it uses cached
	values (if they exist).

:ShowErrors o						*atp-:OpenLog*
:OpenLog, map <F6>l, imap <F6>l
	Opens log file in a new split window with two options (which are set
	locally): 'ruler', 'nospell', and a map 'q' to ':bd'.	

	You can also use the command ':Explore' to see log,aux,... files
	(which is a part of 'netrw' vim plugin).

:Delete[!]						*atp-:Delete*
map <F6>d
	Deletes all files which extension belongs to g:atp_tex_extensions in
	the directory b:atp_OutDir. By default g:atp_tex_extensions does not
	contain '.tex', '.pdf', '.dvi' so none of your important files will be
	deleted. When the command is used with bang it also deletes the
	current output file. 

:SshPrint [printer], [printer_options]			*atp-:SshPrint*
	It will run 'lpr' command and append to it the options defined in the
	variable 'g:printeroptions' + options given in the second argument. It
	prints the pdf or dvi depending on the value of 'b:atp_TexCompiler' (see
	|atp-b:atp_TexCompiler|).  If you specify the variable
	'g:atp_ssh=<user>@<host>' it will print via ssh on the <host> using
	the [printer]. The command ':SshPrint' has a completion set for the
	printers available on your local system or in the host. All the
	arguments of the command SshPrint are |<f-args>|. 
	
	Both arguments are optional (the default system printer is used, and
	only the options 'g:printeroptions' apply).

	The command has completion for the names of printers (also remote
	printers), press <Tab> to cycle through printers, or type first
	letters of the printers name and press <Tab> to complete it.

							*atp-:Lpstat*
:Lpstat
	Sends "lpstat -l" remotly (using the 'g:atp_ssh' value) or locally and
	echoes the output.

							*atp-:ShowOptions* 
:ShowOptions[!] [pattern]
	This will show values of variables that are currently set. 
	With bang it also shows global variables defined in
	'ftplugin/ATP_files/options.vim' (that means almost all global
	variables). Completion lists are filtered out by default. 

	The optional argument [pattern] is used to filter variables names with
	the given pattern.

	TIP: if you are looking for a variable you can use this command to
	find it.

							*atp-:WrapSelection*
:WrapSelection {beginWrapper}, [endWrapper], [cursor_pos], [new_lines]

	Puts selected text inside begin_wrapper: [endWrapper] and sets the
	cursor position according to the variables [cursor_pos]. Possible values
	are: a number (indicates the character of {beginWrapper} to put the
	cursor on (see and check vmap \c below), or 'end' put the cursor at
	the end of [endWrapper] or 'begin' leave the cursor at the beginning
	(to be precise at the end of the starting wrapper).  
	The default [endWrapper] is '}'.  The last argument [new_lines]
	0/1 (default is 0): if 1 then the begin_wrapper and end_wrapper are put
	in seperate lines (the begin line and end line are split), this is
	useful for putting text into and environment \begin{}:\end{}. 

	The command arguments should be separated with commas (see |<args>|).

							*atp-:InteligentWrapSelection*
:InteligentWrapSelection {mathWrapperPair}, {textWrapperPair}, [cursor_pos], [new_lines]

	Puts the selected text inside {mathWrapperPair} if the cursor stands
	in mathematics otherwise inside {textWrapperPair}.
	{mathWrapperPair} {textWrapperPair} are vim lists of length at
	least 1, the first wrapper is the opening and the second is the
	closing one (if not given the default '}' is used. The other arguments
	are as for |atp-:WrapSelection|. If the opening leader in is not
	given then this command is not wrapping the text (see below for the
	suggested map '\tx') 

	The command arguments should be separated with commas (see |<args>|).

	These are the provided maps in visual mode: >
	    vmap <buffer> \rm	:<C-U>InteligentWrapSelection ['\\textrm{'],	['\\mathrm{']<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \em	:<C-U>InteligentWrapSelection ['\\emph{'],	['\\mathit{']<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \it	:<C-U>InteligentWrapSelection ['\\textit{'],	['\\mathit{']<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \sf	:<C-U>InteligentWrapSelection ['\\textsf{'],	['\\mathsf{']<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \tt	:<C-U>InteligentWrapSelection ['\\texttt{'], 	['\\mathtt{']<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \bf	:<C-U>InteligentWrapSelection ['\\textbf{'],	['\\mathbf{']<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \bb	:<C-U>InteligentWrapSelection ['\\textbf{'],	['\\mathbb{']<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \sl	:<C-U>WrapSelection '\\textsl{'<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \sc	:<C-U>WrapSelection '\\textsc{'<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \up	:<C-U>WrapSelection '\\textup{'<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \md	:<C-U>WrapSelection '\\textmd{'<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \n	:<C-U>InteligentWrapSelection ['\\textnormal{'],['\\mathnormal{']<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \cal	:<C-U>InteligentWrapSelection [''],['\\mathcal{']<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>f					:WrapSelection '{\usefont{'.g:atp_font_encoding.'}{}{}{}\selectfont ', '}',(len(g:atp_font_encoding)+11)<CR>
<   	Suggested maps: >
	    vmap <buffer> \tx	:<C-U>InteligentWrapSelection [''],['\\text{']<CR>
	    vmap <buffer> \in	:<C-U>InteligentWrapSelection [''],['\\intertext{']<CR>"
<	The leader '\' in above commands is configurable: the value of
	g:atp_vmap_text_font_leader is used (the default is '\').

	Another provided wrapper: >
	    vmap <buffer> \f :WrapSelection 
	         \ '{\\usefont{".g:atp_font_encoding."}{}{}{}\\selectfont ', '}', '(len(g:atp_font_encoding)+11)'<CR>
<	Where the variable: >
	    g:atp_font_encoding
<	stores the default encoding which is 'OT1', unless you use fontenc
	package, then the default for fontenc is used (the last defined in
	\usepackage[...]{fontenc} see the 'Latex2e font selection'
	/font user guide/ available on CTAN).

	Other wrappers: >
	    vmap m			:WrapSelection '\(', 	'\)'<CR>
	    vmap M			:WrapSelection '\[', 	'\]'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>(		:WrapSelection '(', 	')', 	'begin'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>[		:WrapSelection '[', 	']', 	'begin'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>{		:WrapSelection '{', 	'}', 	'begin'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>)		:WrapSelection '(', 	')', 	'end'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>]		:WrapSelection '[', 	']', 	'end'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>}		:WrapSelection '{', 	'}', 	'end'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>b(	:WrapSelection '\left(', '\right)', 'begin'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>b[	:WrapSelection '\left[', '\right]', 'begin'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>b(	:WrapSelection '\left(', '\right)', 'begin'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>b[	:WrapSelection '\left[', '\right]', 'end'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>b{	:WrapSelection '\left{', '\right}', 'end'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>b{	:WrapSelection '\left{', '\right}', 'end'<CR>
< 	And the maps to put the selected text into an environment: >
	    vmap <LocalLeader>C	:WrapSelection '\begin{center}',	'\end{center}',		'0','1'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>R	:WrapSelection '\begin{flushright}',	'\end{flushright}',	'0','1'<CR>
	    vmap <LocalLeader>L	:WrapSelection '\begin{flushleft}',	'\end{flushleft}',	'0','1'<CR>
<	(note that the arguments for this command must be put in ':' or ":")
   	the highlighted text will put inside \textbf{ }. 

	You can also use a wrapper which was yanked into register 'a': >
		:WrapSelection @a
<  	This will work not only in visual mode. It will operate on last
	selected text. So if you accidentally lost the selection you can still
	use this command (but not the maps)!

:TOC[!] 							*atp-:TOC*
map \t
	Shows Table of Contents of your document. It do not yet support the
	started version of chapter, section,... environemnts. 

	The optional argument bang controls if the table of contents data base
	must be generated: by default map \t doesn't regenerate the toc data
	base (unless if it doesn't exist), :TOC command regenerate the
	data base, :TOC! not.
	
	The function opens new window in which you can use the mappings: 

		'e' 	to echo the line from your tex file
		'y' 	to yank the label of the chapter under the cursor
				to a register, if it exists,
	 	'p' 	to paste it directly to your tex file (just after the
				current cursor position), 
		's'	it splits the window with your tex source file and
			sets the current line to the beginning of the
			chapter/section under the cursor,
		'q' 	to quit, and finaly, 
		<Enter> to go to the chapter under the cursor and close ToC.
		<space> to go to the chapter under the cursor but leave ToC
			open.

	There are also commands: ':C' and ':P', which do the same as 'c' and
	'p' mappings. They all call the function 'Yank(<where>)', the argument
	<where> can be one of: '@<register name>' or 'p'.  

	TOC() supports many edited files. For example if you have in your
	buffer list two files a.tex and b.tex this command will produce table
	of contents of both of them. If you have just one opened window
	(excluding the ToC window) then pressing <space>, <enter>, p and q
	will take you to the right buffer (which will be read if is unloaded
	or hidden). If you split a window then <space>, <enter>,
	p, q will take you to the window from which you are comming. However,
	if you have two windows with two different buffers loaded they will
	act on the window with the matching buffer name.

	The variable t:toc_window_width sets the width of table of contents
	window. By default t:toc_window_width=30. You can set a global
	variable g:toc_window_width to override the default value.

							*atp-:CTOC*
:CTOC	
	This function returns the name of the currently edited chapter/
	section/subsection/subsubsection. Use ':echo CTOC()' or just ':CTOC' to
	see the returned value. If you added a section unit the function will
	not update the database, run ':TOC' to do that (map \t).

:Labels[!]						*atp-:Labels*
map \L 
	Shows labels defined in your file. You can also use the mappings
	'e','c','p','s','q' and <Enter> in the labels window desribed in
	|atp-:TOC|.

	If you forget what are these mappings, write ':map <buffer>' in the
	TOC or LABELS window, or move to the end of the LABELS buffer to see
	some short help info.

	The key 's' shows the context of the label under the cursor (your
	current window splits).

	The variable t:labels_window_width sets the width of labels window. By
	default t:labels_window_width=30. You can set a global
	variable g:labels_window_width to overide the default value.

	Without bang "!" the labels data base will be not generated.
	Different from \t map \L regenerates the database (this is quite
	fast).

							*atp-:NEnv*
:NEnv {environment}
	Move to next environment, for example ':NEnv definition'. Completion
	is set, which finds environments defined in current tex source file.
	This function omits environments in comment lines.

							*atp-:PEnv*
:PEnv {environment}
	Move to previous environment, for example ':NEnv definition'. Completion
	is set, which finds environments defined in current tex source file.
	This function omits environments in comment lines.


							*atp-:NextSection*
							*atp-:NSSec*
							*atp-:NSec*
							*atp-:NChap*
							*atp-:NPart*
:NPart, :NChap, :NSec, :NSSec [title_pattern] [search_tool] [mode]
map <LocalLeaader>np, map <LocalLeader>ns, map <LocalLeader>ns
	Goes to next <section>, the commands need not to be explained.
	Note: the maps work in visual mode and operator pending mode ('d\ns'
	will delete till the end of the section). You can use 'n' and 'N' vim
	in normal or visual mode to go further. 

	[title_pattern] is the pattern which will match for the pattern, it
	should start with '.*' when you want to match somewhere in a midle of
	the title. 
	
	[search_tool] is one of atp/vim, with 'atp' (the defualt) uses the
	|atp-:S| command, when 'vim' is uses the vim |search()| function.

	[mode] one of n/v/V : n - normal mode (default), v - the visual mode,
	V- visual line wise mode. Visual modes are used in vmaps. In visual
	mode it selects from the cursor position (or line) till next section.


							*atp-:PrevSection*
							*atp-:PSSec*
							*atp-:PSec*
							*atp-:PChap*
							*atp-:PPart*
:PPart, :PChap, PSec, PSSec [title_pattern] [search_tool] [mode]
map <LocalLeader>pp, map <LocalLeader>pc, map <LocalLeader>ps
	Goes to previous <section>.
	For descirption of arguments read |atp-:NextSection| just above.

ToDo({keyword}, {stop}, [bufname])		*atp-function-ToDo*
:ToDo [bufname]					*atp-:ToDo*
:Note [bufname]					*atp-:Note*
	The function list all the lines of the buffer [bufname] which match
	for the pattern '%.*{keyword}'. The {stop} argument is the pattern to
	before which to stop. The optional argument is the buffer
	name (the buffer name completion is set on). If not given the
	current buffer is assumed.
	You can set highlighting for this command by:
		highlight atp-Todo ctermfg=... 	guifg=...
	The command :ToDo sets keyword='\c\<todo\>' and
	stop='\s*%.*\c\<note\>', and the command :Note
	sets keyword='\c\<note\>' and stop='\s*%.*\c\<todo\>'. This prevent
	from listing ToDo lines with Notes and vice versa. 
	 
:ToggleSpace, map <F2>				*atp-:ToggleSpace*
	This function (command) sets, if it is undefined or removes if it is
	defined, the mapping:
>
		:cmap <Space> \_s\+
<
	which is useful when searching by the command '/', especially if
	|'textwidth'| or |'wrapmargin'| is non zero (and |'formatoptions'|
	contains one of the flags 't', 'v' or 'b'). Then each <Space> will
	match for a space or end of line.

							*atp-:ToggleStar*
:ToggleStar 	 		adds/removes a star from the current 
map <LocalLeader>s		environment (if it is not one belonging 
				to the list: >
					g:atp_no_star_environments
<				
							*atp-:ToggleEnvironment*
:ToggleEnvironment 	mapped to <F4> and <S-F4>, switches environment
map <F4>, map <S-F4>    name. See (i.e. echo ) g:atp_toggle_environments_1...7 
			(you can change or add your own variables,
			just add numbers - they must be consecutive).

							*atp-:ToggleLabels*
							*atp-g:atp_toggle_labels*
	It also changes the prefixes of labels (if there is one, which belongs
	to g:atp_shortnames_dict) and all ref's (\ref, \eqref and \pageref).
	You have to turn on this feature by putting g:atp_toggle_labels=1 (by
	default it is 0).  Check if it works for you!  If there is a label or
	reference to which it wants to change it doesn't change labels and
	issue a Warning Message, thus I believe it should work for every one,
	but as this changes your file it is turned off by default.) 


:SetOutDir						*atp-:SetOutDir*
	This is a command which sets the 'b:atp_OutDir' variable and the |'errorfile'| option.
	See |atp-b:atp_OutDir| for the default value.

:SetErrorFile						*atp-:SetErrorFile*
	If you change |atp-b:atp_OutDir| variable and you want to update the
	|'errorfile'| option use this command. It will show you the value to
	which |'errorfile'| was set. 

:Status[!]						*atp-:ATPStatus*
	This function (command) sets the status line, which include: the name
	of currently eddited   chapter (or section) the value of
	'b:atp_OutDir' (unless used with bang!) and it will warn you if
	'b:atp_OutDir' variable is not set. This function is called at startup
	unless the variable 'g:atp_statusline=0' is set. The status is set by
	the autocommand: >
		au BufWinEnter *.tex :call Status()
<	In this way every opened window with a '*.tex' file will get the correct
	status line.


:FontSearch[!] [pattern]				*atp-:FontSearch*
	
	For example:
	:FontSearch ^t1
		will list all the fd files in your tex distribution which
		names starts with t1 (i.e. which describes fonts in encoding
		'T1')
	:FontSearch! bookman
		will list all fd files which full path matches 'bookman'.

	In the opened window there are several mappings defined:
	    <Enter>   	open the fd file under the cursor
	    <Tab>	list fonts defined in the fd file (shows the command
			that you can use in your tex file to use this font)
	    p		preview the fonts defined in the fd file under the
			cursor, do not shows the latex source. 	
	    P		preview fonts and show the latex source 
			(then you can see the errors why the preview was not
			produced; in many cases there are no encoding files or
			fonts themselves for which you have to look in CTAN
			archive yourself; or YOU CAN just SEE HOW TO USE 
			FONTS :) )
	    q 		close the window (actually, delete the buffer using
		       :bd, it will be still in the list if you type ":ls!",
		       so even then you can reload previous searches.)  

	In addition to 'p' and 'P' maps there is a :Preview command. 
	Note: the maps 'p' and 'P' work in both normal and visual mode.
	You can select a part of the text and use this maps or the command
	:Preview to make one preview file for all the font files.


	The same mappings are defined in the window with fd file opened
	(except <Enter>, <Tab>).  

	Additionally, read |font-lowlevelcommands| to learn how to use
	|\usefont|, |\fontsize|, |\selectfont| and other such commands.
	The 'Latex 2e font selection' by 'LeTeX3 Project Team' might be very
	useful. It is available on the net (you probably have it in your tex
	distribution if it is installed with the documentation, if not check
	the CTAN archive).

	ATP also has a very nice completion for various font declaration
	commands, see |atp-completion-fontdeclaration|.

	Hopefully, this will help your documents to become beautiful :)

							*atp-:FontPreview*
:FontPreview[!] {fdFile} [encoding] [keep_tex]
	Previews all fonts defined in fd file matching the pattern <fd_file>
	with encoding [encoding] (optional). If [keep_tex] is 1 (defualt is 0)
	it will keep the latex source file for debugging purposes.

	Without [!] it matches just the name of the fd files, with [!] the
	pattern {fdFile} matches for full path.

	It returns a list of fonts which fd files matches the {fdFile} pattern in
	[encoding]. You will be asked to chose for which files make a preview,
	possible answers are: >
			1,2,3
< 	which is equivalent to >
			1-3
<	you can also mix this notation: >
			1,2-5,7	
<	As in FontSearch command the [keep_tex] variable specifies if
	the source file will be shown (for debugging purposes, or just to look how
	to use the font :).

:PID 							*atp-:PID*
	Prints PIDs of all running instances of |atp-b:atp_TexComopiler|.

			article 		<-- bib field keyword 
			author,title,...	<-- bib entry label 	
			<label>			<-- bib field label 	


One more function is provided which searches the bib files for bib fields, 
and for the bib field labels for the latex command \cite{}.

BibSearch({bang}, [pattern], [flags])				*atp-BibSearch* 
	The function BibSearch allows you to search for the [pattern] in bib
	files and opens a new window with results. For the command, please read
	|atp-:BibSearch|.

	{bang} has two possible values "!" or "", with "!" it looks first for
	input files, while if {bang}="" only if ATP has not done it yet. 

	The function BibSearch takes two arguments (the last one is optional).
	The first one is the [pattern] to match against each line of the
	bibliographic files supplied in the commands \bibliography (if there
	are several names,please do not add a white space ' ' after ',' unless
	the file name begins with a space, i.e.
>
 	\bibliography(Mathematics, Physics,/home/user/Bibliography)
< 
	then the plugin will understand that the names of the bib files are
	'Mathematics.bib', ' Physics.bib' and '/home/user/Bibliography.bib'.

								*atp-bibpatterns*
	Each line of every bib file found in your tex document will be
	matched against the pattern, for example if the pattern is:
>
 		'author.*Grothendieck'
<
	the BibSearch function will find all the bibliographic fields
	which in one line have the words 'author' and 'Grothendieck' (in most
	cases it means that you will see only works of Grothendieck). Another
	example:
>
		'^\(\s*author.*Joayl\)\|Galois Theory'
<
	will result in all bib fields which author is Joyal or 
	which includes the words 'Galois Theory' (which by the way apear in
	many article/book titles), yet another example:	
>
		'author.*Joayl\|title\p*Galois Theory'
<
	This will match against all bib entries written by Joyal or which title
	includes the word 'Galois Theory'.
>
 		:call BibSearch('author.*Joyal\&.*Tirney')	
<	
	will find all the bib entries which were written by Joyal and Tirney
	(and maybe somebody else). 

	For now, there is no possibility to filter bibliographic entries which
	both match a pattern in separate lines, i.g. to show all bib entries
	written by Joyal on 'Descent Theory'.

	Before a match, all '{', and '}' are deleted from the line of the bib file.
	But you will see them in the output (what can be useful for debugging
	errors in bib files)

	Note that in Vim patterns should be quoted using '...' not "...".   

	Further examples are supplied after the next section
	|atp-bibflags:examples|, which describes other functionalities of the
	BibSearch/BibChoose commands.

								*atp-bibpattern:last*
								*atp-bib-b:atp_LastBibPattern*
	The variable 'b:atp_LastBibPattern' stores the last pattern used by
	bib search.

								*atp-bibflags*
	The first optional argument [flags] chooses what and in which order
	you want to see the  bib entries found (entries are listed in
	the order they appear in bib file).  Flag is a word made of letters.
	There are three kinds of flags: entry flags which matches against
	labels of bib entries, like author, title, etc..., and keyword flags: which
	matches against keywords of bib fields: @article, @book, @techreport,
	etc...  and two special flags 'All' and 'L'. A flag is a word on
	letters:
>
		a  - author
 		e  - editor
 		t  - title
 		b  - booktitle
 		j  - journal
 		s  - series
 		y  - year
 		n  - number
 		v  - volume
 		p  - pages
 		P  - Publisher
 		N  - Note
 		S  - School
 		h  - howpublished
 		o  - organization
		u  - url	
		H  - Homepage	
  any other letter - do not show anything but the first line of bib entry 
		@a - article 						/@article/
		@b - book or booklet 					/@book,@booklet/
		@B - Booklet 						/@booklet/	
		@c - incollection 					/@incollection,@inbook/
		@p - proceedings, inproceedings, conference   		/@proceedings,@inproceedings,@conference/
		@m - misc 						/@misc/
		@M - Manual 						/@manual/
		@t - master or PhD thesis  				/@masterthesis,@phdthesis/
		@T - Techreport 					/@techreport/
		@u - unpublished  					/@unpublished/		
		All - all flags						(see |atp-bibflags:all|)		
		L   - last flags					(see |atp-bibflags:last|)		
<
	Examples:
>
		tayu@a		--> show the entries: tile, author, year, url of matching articles.
		baeP@b		--> show the entries: booktitle, author, editor, 
 							publisher of matching books (@book,@booklet).
<
	Flags '@.' are filtered out, if one does not belong to the one above
	then it is deleted. You can see which flags are defined using
	ShowOptions function/command (they are listed as Available
	KeyWordFlags).
								*atp-bibflags:default*
	The default flag is stored in the global variable g:defaultbibflags and is
	equal to 'tabejsyu'. This means that the output for each bib field found 
	will include the 
		title
		author
		booktitle
		editor
		journal 
		series
		year
	if title,author,... are specified in the bibliography for the given
	position. If there are many position which match you can set flags to
	be as simple as possible to include more lines on the screen. For
	example 'tabe' is quite reasonable (note that all bib entries are
	matched separately, i.e. if a bib field has both 'title' and 'booktitle'
	bib entries it will give you both of them.

								*atp-bibsearch-show-only-keys*
	If you just want to list just the lines with bib fields keywords:
	@article{, @book{, etc. supply a flag which do not belongs to
	'g:defaultallbibflags', for example 'X', or 'X@a'
	
								*atp-bibflags:+*
	You can also specify flags with '+', for example: 
>
	flags='+p'
	flags='+@b'
<
	This feature ADDS FLAGS TO THE DEFAULT VALUE defined in the variable
	g:defaultbibflags (see |atp-defaulbibflags|). The first will result in
	showing the default entries and the page number, the second will
	result in showing only books with the default bib entries. You can
	specify as many additional flags as you wish.  *atp-bibflags:output*
	Note that the function shows the line with database file name if there
	are entries in this bibliography which match the pattern thus,for
	example, if you specify the flag '@a' and you see the line with
	database file name, but you do not see any bib entry, then in this
	database there are bib fields which match but these are not articles.
	
								*atp-bibflags:all*
	The flags='All' is a synonim of flag=g:defaultallbibflags which by default is
	equal to'tabejfsvnyPNSohiuHcp' i.e. all flags in this order. If you
	add your own flag you should change this global variable. You can add to
	this flag any flag which contains '@' (see |atp-bibflags|) by
	the plus operator, i.e. All+@a@b or +@aAll will give the same result.

								*atp-bibflags:last*
								*atp-bib-b:atp_LastBibFlags*	
	The variable 'b:atp_LastBibFlags' stores the recently used flags. The flag
	'L' sets the flags for this search to the value of 'b:atp_LastBibFlags'.
	You can write '+L@a', '+L@a', 'L@a' or '@aL' but not '+@La', if you
	want to add some flags to previous searches. Next time the flag 'L'
	will change the meaning (i.e. it is really the last time not earlier
	:) However, there is no '-' :( '-@aL' could be helpful.
	 
	The variable 'b:atp_LastBibFlags' is not changed when you use the 'All'
	flag.

								*atp-bibflags:add-flag*
	You can add your own flags but not keyword flags (i.e. @a,@b,...).
	Just add an entry to the dictionary g:bibflagsdict. (:ShowOptions v to
	see its current value), For example
>
	let g:bibflagsdict=extend(g:bibflagsdict, 
	\ { '<flags_name>' : [ '<bib_entry_name>': '<how_to_show>'] })
< 
	where, <flags_name> is the flag to use (it should be one letter), it
	must be different from the defined flags, <bib_entry_name> is a
	lowercase bib entry name, like 'title', 'url', etc., <how_to_show> if
	you want to have a nice output put the bib entry name and that much of
	white spaces to get 13 strings.
		
:BibChoose {BibEntry[RegisterName]}					*atp-:BibChoose*
map c, map y, map p
	This function/command is only available in the window with BibSearch results
	and allows to copy a bib entry key to a register or directly to the
	last opened buffer (after the cursor position). It is mapped to 'c'
	and 'y'. You will be asked to give the number of bib entry to yank:
>
	    <bib entry number><register name><Enter>	- to copy it to a register
	    <bib entry number><Enter>			- to paste it to 'tex' file
	    <Enter>					- to skip the choice
<	
	When you paste the bib entry key the bib search window will close. For
	example: >
		:BibChoose 5e
		:BibChoose 7+
		:BibChoose 2
<	Copy the bibkey to register e,+ or paste directly to the buffer 
	in which :BibSearch was invoked, at last curosr position.	

	The same you will obtain using tha nmaps y or c. 
	
	This commands and maps are only in the BibSearch buffer.

								*atp-bibsearch-highlight*
	The colours of the output are set by the syntax file
	'syntax/bibsearch_atp.Vim'. All groups except one are the same as in
	the syntax file for bib files ('syntax/bib.Vim' in your $VIMRUNTIME
	directory). Their names are 'bibsearchEntryKw' instead 'bibEntryKw'.
	The one that is differently defined 'bibsearchComment'.  Which is
	changed in that way to highlight the bib file names.  One additional
	highlight group is: 'bibsearchInfo'. It highlights the number of
	entry and its line number in the bib file. By default all bibsearch
	groups are linked to the corresponding bib group, the bibsearchInfo
	group is not set.
	
	In a colour file (~/.Vim/color/*.Vim) you can use these groups to set
	colours.  See |highlight| or just read a colour file. For example,
	this is a nice set of colours for dark background 
		
							 	
:BibSearch [pattern] [flag] 					*atp-:BibSearch*
	which do what you expect. The arguments should not be quoted and
	separated by a white spaces (if you want to include a white space use
	'\ '), for more see |f-args|. If you do not provide any argument then
	all entries of all bib files will be shown. Examples:

	Some examples:						*atp-bibflags:examples*
>
	    :BibSearch 
<				Above command shows all bib fields with
				the default flags
>
	    :BibSearch @ yt	
<				and this is a tip how to show all bib fields with
				different flags than the default ones(the '@'
				will match at every bib field!). It is
				equivalent to:
>
	    :call BibSearch('','yt')

	    :BibSearch title[\s.]*Galois Theory  aetb
<
	The next one shows all bib fields which were written by Joyal and
	Tirney (and may by somebody else).
>
	    :BibSearch 'author.*Joyal\&.*Tirney'
<

:DefiSearch[!] [pattern] 					*atp-:DefiSearch*
	Both argument are optional.
	Finds all definitions which matches the pattern. It looks in the main
	file (only in the preambule, unless the optional bang '!' is used) and
	all the input files (except bib files).

	The pattern is any vim pattern.

								*atp-bibsearch-variables*
								*atp-variables-bib*	
SOME VARIABLES:
	All the values of important variables can be shown by ShowOption
	command.

								*atp-b:bibfiles*
>
 b:bibfiles							
<	This variable is a list and you can put here additional bib files.
	They will be parsed by the BibSearch/BibChoose functions.

	The following variables you can see using the ShowOptions command (see
	|atp-ShowOptions|). >
 s:bibfiles
<	This variable is a list which stores bib files found in your tex
	files and which are readable. It is set up when you first run of the commands:
	BibSearch/BibChoose/ShowOptions. Its value is shown by the
	functions FindBibFiles({bufname}). >
 s:allbibfiles 
<	this is a sum of found bib files the locally defined b:bibfiles, which
	not necessarily are readable. >
 s:notreadablebibfiles
<	guess what :)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
								*atp-bibsearch-comments*
	Please do not hesitate to report any bug to me:
	mszamot@gmail.com 							
	
	The algorithm will work only if all kind of bib entries of your bib
	file are included in the list g:bibentries. However, changing just
	this variable is not enough. In that case the search engine (function
	s:search) will produce correct output, but the function which displays
	found entries, will not know how to work with the new entries. One
	would have to add an entry to the dictionary 'g:bibflagsdict'. If
	it is the case, please let me know: mszamot [AT] gmail [DOT] com  

	As you can see entries of the type '@string' which can be used in bib
	files are not supported (i.e. there is no function which substitutes
	the variables defined in @string to their values), but it is doable.
			@string{ Name = Value }
			

================================================================================
COMPLETION			                        *atp-completion*

The completion is by default mapped to <Tab>. For example if you type
\math<Tab> you will get a list of choices which completes this command. (See
':h popupmenu-completion' and ':h completion' for more).

There are two completion algorithm: expert mode  and non expert mode: the
keyword for completion in expert mode must match at the beginning, in non
expert mode any where. Also in expert mode the list of possible completions is
smaller (for example there is no '\lneqq', there is only '\lneq').

If you prefer to not map <Tab> key (you can use '>' '<' to make the tabulation
in visual mode - see ':h >') then you can define g:atp_no_tab_map=1 in your
Vimrc file. 

You can switch a completion mode adjusting the variable
'g:atp_completion_active_modes', all names of completion modes are stored in the
variable 'g:atp_tab_completion_modes'.

If 'g:atp_local_completion' is set to non zero value, then input files
will be scanned for \def, \newcommand, \newnevironment and \newtheorem
commands and they will be used for completion. (if its value is 1 then this
will be done during first completion - this is the default, if it is set to
2 then this will be done at start up.

	NOTE: if you press <Tab> but then you changed your mind, the
	completion pop-up menu allows to cancel completion: press ctrl+p (i.e.
	go up - some times more than once) and then press <space>.

							*atp-:ToggleTab*
There is a command to toggle the tab map off/on: :ToggleTab, it is also mapped
to `<Tab>. 

	Note: You can use <CTRL-T> in insert mode to insert shiwftwidth
	(see |i_CTRL-T|) and <CTRL-D> to delete one shiftwidht (read |i_CTRL-D|).

Completion modes are:

	commands					*atp-completion-commands*
		if g:atp_check_if_math_mode = 1 then the pull of commands
		contains math commands only if there you are inside a math
		environment. This works perfectly if you switch from $:$ and
		$$:$$ to their equivalent (and more up-to-date) \(:\) and \[:\].
		The list of math environment in which ATP will think you are
		editing a math mode is stored in the variable:
		'g:atp_math_modes'. Its entries are two element list of
		patterns which matches the beginning and end of a math mode.
		The '0' entry have to provide the beginning and end pattern of
		in line math '\(:\)', the second for displayed math '\[:\]'.
		Its default value is given below.
	
		If you add a package (like tikz or amsmath, or amssymb) then
		the pull of completions will contain extra
		commands/environment names defined in these packages.  
		Because some classes calls amsmath package silently 
		setting the variable 'g:atp_amsmath=1' will ensure that 
		you will get completions for these commands. The algorithm
		checks if you have this package declared or if you use some of
		the standard ams class (actually checks if the document class
		name matches '^ams'). 

		If you do not want math commands completions at all define
		':let g:atp_no_math_command_completion=1' (you can put it in your
		~/.vimrc, or define while writing, both will work, so you can
		switch off the math completions temporarily)

		The label command completes in a special way: for example in
		a line like:
			\begin{theorem}\lab<Tab>
		will complete to 
			\begin{theorem}\label{thm:
		The dictionary of short names is 'g:atp_shortname_dict'. If
		you do not likes this idea (however it can help you to
		correctly write \ref{ - to avoid referring to lemmas as
		propositions, and also it makes completion for \ref{ nicer
		- you can list only labels for theorems), so if you do not
		want it anyway: 'let g:atp_no_short_names=1' will make the
		work.

							*atp-variables-local_completion*
							*atp-b:local_commands*
							*atp-g:local_commands*
							*atp-b:local_environments*
							*atp-g:local_environments*
		By default the first time you are completing an environment
		name or a command a list of locally defined environments and
		commands is made (it takes a few seconds). If you do not want
		to completions for them define "let g:atp_local_completion=0",
		if g:atp_local_completion=2" then the search for local
		definitions and commands will be done on startup. If you
		added a command or an environment the command
		:LocalCommands! will update the list of local definitions, but
		also the list of packages used by your latex source file
		( completion lists are only used by Tab Completion function if
		the package was given, thus it is necessary to run this
		command if the preambule has changed)
		The output is stored in two variables: >
				b:atp_local_commands
				b:atp_local_environments
<
		If you use the same set of definitions in every tex file
		you can set >
				g:atp_local_commands 
				g:atp_local_environments
<
		which if defined are used instead of b:atp_local_commands and
		b:atp_local_environments (use the command :LocalCommands
		to generate the list and then use the command: 
		    :let @a= b:atp_local_commands 
		i.e. copy the variable to register a and paste it in your Vimrc file.)

		There is an extended support for tikz picture environment both
		inline \tikz{:} and displayed
		\begin{tikzpicture}:\end{tikzpicture}. The completion works
		for commands and keywords. The pull of them is enlarged if you
		add a tikz library. Yet not all the libraries are
		supported but this is just the matter of my time. Normal
		commands are added if you are inside {:}.


	ref/label/cite					*atp-completion-ref*
							*atp-completion-label*
							*atp-completion-cite*
		for label completion puts short names, for ref and eqref
		commands the completions are the labels found in all files
		associated to the main file (the plugin searches the input
		and include files for them). The same for cite: which searches
		also in bib files defined in the main file.

		There is also omnicompletion (CTRL-X CTRL-O, see
		|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|) for \cite command. Check it out, as it is
		very nice (especially in gvim!) and very fast. 

		For both completion and omnicompletion for the cite command,
		the text after \cite{  [ or after a comma after \cite{ ] is
		treated as a regular expression. Thus you can wirte:

		\cite{.*author1\&.*author2<Tab>

		to get the completions for things written by both author 1 and
		2 (regardless of the order they appear in bib files).

		BibTeX omni completion is triggered by '\cite{', '\citep{' or '\citet{'.
		For example, assume you have in your .bib files an entry looking like: >

		@book {	knuth1981,
				author = "Donald E. Knuth",
				title = "Seminumerical Algorithms",
				publisher = "Addison-Wesley",
				year = "1981" }

		Then, try: >

			\cite{Knuth 1981<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
			\cite{algo<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
<

		From version 7.3.4 \ref{<pattern><Tab> matches the label name for
		the pattern (before the actual pattern had always prenteded
		'^'). When pattern is muched for a number of a label '^' is added
		in front of the pattern. In this case both completion modes:
		expert and non-expert works in the same way.

    You can also use regular expressions (or vim patterns) after '\cite{'.

	brackets					*atp-completion-brackets*
		Closing of brackets {:},{:},[:],(:) (also closes math modes \(:\) and
		\[:\]). 
		Relelvant variables are: g:atp_bracket_dict a dictionary of
		brackets by default it consists of pairs '(' : ')', '{' : '}',
		'[' : ']'. There is a second dictionary g:atp_sizes_of_brackets
		which contains all the sizes of brackets in latex plus a pair
		'\' : '\', for closing the math modes: \(:\), \[:\] and the
		brackets \{:\}.
															
	environments					*atp-closing-environments*
							*atp-completion-env*
		Completes after '\begin{' and '\end{'. For example
		'\begin{cen<Tab>' will give '\begin{center}' 
		But '\begin{theorem}<Tab>' or
		'\begin{theorem}\label{thm:1}<Tab> will close the environment.
		The algorithm tries to close environment in many natural
		situations: for example when it did found less than one command
		completion. It closes the right environment when they are
		nested (however not in right place!) and it preserves the
		indention. When after \begin{center}\label{...} XXX is
		something (in place of XXX) it will close the environment in
		after the cursor position otherwise in next line.

		That is, if you like to write \begin{}:\end{} in the beginning

		support for nested environments then!

	font declarations				*atp-completion-fontdeclaration*
		This is completion for the commands 
		    \usefont{<encoding>}{<font_familly>}{<font_series>}{<font_shape>},
		    \fontencoding{<encoding>},
		    \fontfamily{<font_family>},
		    \fontseries{<font_series>},
		    \fontshape{<font_shape>},
		    \DeclareFixedFont{<cmd>}{<encoding>}{<font_familly>}{<font_series>}{<font_shape>}{<size>}
		
		It first splits the line and take a part between the commands
		\selectfont (if there is not \selectfont command this step is
		omitted).

		Then if the <encoding> is declared the font families for the
		completion will only come from this <encoding>.

		If <font_family> is defined, <font_series> and <font_shape>
		come from the particular font definition file (the declared
		encoding is used if not the value of
		|atp-g:atp_font_encoding| is used).

		If <font_family> and <font_series> are defined then the
		<font_shape> for this font (in the above encoding) is found.
		

	bibstyle
		Completion for the command '\bibliographystyle{'. Finds all
		"bst" files avaiable in your tex distribution. 


	documentclass
		Completion for the command '\documentclass'. Returns list of
		all classes available in your distribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------
							*atp-completion-variables*

(if the value is given it is the default, if it is not means it is too long to
put it here).

				the second	 - search for \[:\]  [ displayed math ]
				the third	 - search for \begin{<env>:\end{<env>	
				the fourth	 - for environments defined in
						   the variable g:atp_long_environments

				You can also put "-1" as the values of
				g:atp_completion_limits, then the search
				forward/backward will last till first/last

				(for that you have to change the third

OMNI-COMPLETION 					*atp-omnicompletion*
by David Munger (LatexBox plugin)

Completion is achieved through omni completion |compl-omni|, with default
bindings <CTRL-X><CTRL-O>. There are four types of completion:



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

							*atp-omnicompletion-commands*
Commands ~

Command completion is triggered by the '\' character.  For example, >
	\beg<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
completes to >
	\begin{

Associated settings:
	|atp-g:LatexBox_completion_commands|
	|atp-g:LatexBox_completion_close_braces|


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

							*atp-omnicompletion-environments*
Environments ~

Environment completion is triggered by '\begin{'.  For example, >
	\begin{it<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
completes to >
	\begin{itemize}

Completion of '\end{' automatically closes the last open environment.

Associated settings:
	|atp-g:LatexBox_completion_environments|
	|atp-g:LatexBox_completion_close_braces|


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

							*atp-omnicompletion-labels*
Labels ~

Label completion is triggered by '\ref{' or '\eqref{'.  For example, >
	\ref{sec:<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
offers a list of all matching labels, with their associated value and page number.
Labels are read from the aux file, so label completion works only after
complilation.

It matches:
	1. labels: >
		\ref{sec:<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
<	2. numbers: >
		\eqref{2<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
<	3. labels and numbers together (separated by whitespace): >
		\eqref{eq 2<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
	

Associated settings:
	|atp-g:LatexBox_ref_pattern|
	|atp-g:LatexBox_completion_close_braces|


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

							*atp-omnicompletion-bibtex*
BibTeX entries ~

BibTeX completion is triggered by '\cite{', '\citep{' or '\citet{'.
For example, assume you have in your .bib files an entry looking like: >

	@book {	knuth1981,
		author = "Donald E. Knuth",
		title = "Seminumerical Algorithms",
		publisher = "Addison-Wesley",
		year = "1981" }

Then, try: >

	\cite{Knuth 1981<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
	\cite{algo<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>

You can also use regular expressions (or vim patterns) after '\cite{'.

Associated settings:
*atp-g:LatexBox_cite_pattern*		Default: '\\cite\(p\|t\)\?\*\?\_\s*{'
*atp-g:LatexBox_ref_pattern*		Default: '\\v\?\(eq\|page\)\?ref\*\?\_\s*{'

	Patterns to match \cite and \ref commands for BibTeX and label completion.
	Must include the trailing '{'.
	To match all commands that contain 'cite' (case insensitive), use: >
		let g:LatexBox_cite_pattern = '\c\\\a*cite\a*\*\?\_\s*{'
<	To match all commands that end with 'ref' (case insensitive): >
		let g:LatexBox_ref_pattern = '\c\\\a*ref\*\?\_\s*{'
<	Both examples match commands with a trailing star too.

*atp-g:LatexBox_bibtex_wild_spaces*		Default: 1

	If nonzero, spaces act as wildcards ('.*') in completion.
	For example, if nonzero, >
		\cite{Knuth 1981
<	is equivalent to >
		\cite{Knuth.*1981

*atp-g:LatexBox_completion_close_braces*	Default: 1

	If nonzero, omni completion will add closing brackets where relevant.
	For example, if nonzero, >
		\begin{itemize
<	completes to >
		\begin{itemize}

*atp-g:LatexBox_completion_environments*
*atp-g:LatexBox_completion_commands*

	Static completion lists for environments
	|atp-omnicompletion-environments| and commands
	|atp-omnicompletion-commands|.

================================================================================
HOW TO CONFIGURE ATP TO YOUR NEEDS                      *atp-configure*
							*atp-variables*

There are several options you can set, and they might be set in your Vimrc
file. The default values are given below (except the completion setup and
bibtex documented above).

Tip: If you want to see (almost) all the variables, type ':let g:atp-<CTRL+d>',
and ':let b:<CTRL+d>'.

All buffer variables (see |b:var|), i.e. these which name begins with "b:",
should be set in your Vimrc file. The best way to do that is by using
autocommand:
>
	au BufReadPre *.tex let b:atp_TexCompiler="latex"
<
If you put just let b:atp_TexCompiler, this will also work but not always: for
example when you open a new buffer in existing Vim session.

let b:atp_TexCompiler="pdflatex" 			*atp-b:atp_TexCompiler*
	Used by functions: TEX() (map \l, imap \l), VTEX() (map <F5>, imap <F5>)

	You can set it to latex, tex, luatex, and so on and possibly to
	lilypond as well. 

let b:atp_TexOptions=""
	If you want to set some additional options to your tex compiler you can
	use this variable, note that -output-directory, and -mode, are
	already used. You can use this to make reverse searching with xdvi see
	|atp-xdvi|.

							*atp-b:atp_OutDir*
let b:atp_OutDir=fnameescape(fnamemodify(resolve(expand("%:p")),":h")) . "/"
Used by ViewOutput(), TEX(), VTEX(), BibTeX(), TexLog(), Pdffonts(), Delete() 
			i.e. in all functions.

	This is the directory in which tex will put the output files. If the
	open file is not a symbolic link it is equal to the directory in which
	the tex file is located. If the open file is a symbolic link it points
	to the directory in which the real file is located. 
	
	If you set this variable to './' (or '.') and change the current
	working directory for example to /tmp (:cd /tmp) then the latex output
	will be placed in /tmp, i.e. it will move with with cd. However, the
	default value of b:atp_OutDir is not affected by :cd command.

	White spaces and other characters should not be escaped. It will be
	quoted in '...' using the |shellescape()| function.

	You can see the current output directory in the status (it is in the
	short notation) to see it whole type:
		:echo b:atp_OutDir
	or use the function ShowOptions() (see |apt-:ShowOptions|).		

	If in your environment the variable $TEXMFOUTDIR is set the value of
	b:atp_OutDir will be set to its value.

							*atp-ProjectFiles*
							*atp-b:atp_MainFile*
let b:atp_MainFile	= expand("%:p")
	This variable points to the main file of the project, it is set on the
	start up to the file you open. If you edit project file, start with the
	main file and use gf (see |atp-gf|) to go to the project file you want
	to edit. In this way all the project files will have correctly set
	this variable. The value of this variable is used by compilation
	functions.

	Another good tip for LaTeX project files is to set g:tex_flavor
	variable to 'tex' (in your vimrc or atprc file). This will prevent
	from situations that vim recognizes input file as a plain TeX while it
	is an imput file into LaTeX project. 

	For LaTeX project file it might be neccesary to add options to
	'viewoptions' (see |'viewoptions'|). And set mkview and loadview via
	autocommands >
		au BufWinLeave *.tex mkview
		au BufWinEnter *.tex silent loadview
<	This will ensure that filetype variable is set correctly. Some tools
	of ATP behaves in a different way in plaintex files. For example
	TreeOfFiels function (it makes a tree of files. It is recursive in
	LaTeX files but not in plain TeX files) on which is based the
	command :LocalCommands which makes list of commands, environments and
	colors for Tab Completion.

let b:atp_auruns	= 1				*atp-b:atp_auruns*
	This variable control how many times the automatic function calls tex
	compiler (consecutively). It is useful if you are working with PDF
	files and you want to have bookmarks (you can get them using hyperref
	package with the option: bookmarks. Then set b:atp_auruns to '2'.

let g:atp_autex_check_if_closed = 1  			*atp-g:atp_autex_check_if_closed*
	This feature is not implemented.
	tex run if all environments \begin:\end, \(:\) and \[:\] are closed.
	Set g:atp_autex_check_if_closed=0 in order to not make the checks.

let g:texmf=$HOME/texmf					*atp-g:texmf*
	This variable configures where input files are placed. See
	|atp-:EditInputFile|.

let g:askforoutdir=0					*atp-g:askforoutdir*
	Its values are 1 and 0.  When it is set to 1 you will be asked for the
	name of a directory where tex will put output files, note that this
	name should end with a "/".

let b:atp_Viewer="xpdf"					*atp-b:atp_Viewer*
	it was tested with xpdf, evince, epdfviewer, kpdf, okular, xdvi and
	they all works fine. I'm using xpdf and the xpdf server options are
	supported so that the file is automatically reloaded (other viewers,
	except epdfview, have this functionality as well. This do not works
	for acroread. Read more about viewers in |atp-viewers|. 

	If you use program b:atp_Viewer then you can use the variable
	b:atp_{b:atp_Viewer}Options to set the options, for example if b:atp_Viewer="xpdf"
	then you might use:

							*atp-Viewer_Options*
							*atp-b:xdviOptions*
    							*atp-b:xpdfOptions*
    							*atp-b:okularOptions*
    							*atp-b:evinceOptions*
    b:atp_xpdfOptions					
    b:atp_xdviOptions
    b:atp_okularOptions
    b:atp_evinceOptions, etc ... (and also g:atp_...Options variables)
	Used by function: ViewOutput() (map \v, map <F3>, imap <F3>)

	For example, if you want to have different look of one document you can
	set it to "-bg gray20". Some examples:
>
 	let b:atp_xpdfOptions	= "-bg Grey30 -mattecolor SlateBlue2 -papercolor White"
	let g:atp_xpdfOptions	= "-bg NavajoWhite4 -fg black -mattecolor burlywood"
	let b:atp_xdviOptions	= "-expertmode 0 -s 6"
<	
 
let b:atp_XpdfServer=fnamemodify(expand("%"),":t")		*atp-g:atp_XpdfServer*	
	Used by function: ViewOutput() (map \v, map <F3>, imap <F3>)

	It is equal to the name of the source file. You do not need escape
	spaces in the name (shellescape() function is used before it is send
	to the shell).

let b:atp_OpenViewer=1					*atp-b:atp_OpenViewer*
	If the function which calls TeX compiler do not see that you are
	viewing the output file it will open it for you if b:atp_OpenViewer=1.
	Otherwise, this feature is disabled.

let g:rmcommand="perltrash"				*atp-g:rmcommand*
	Used by function: Delete() (map <F6>d imap <F6>d)	

	If you have another 'trash can' program you can use it here, if you do
	not have it you can use "rm" (at your own risk). It is used to delete
	the files produced by (La)TeX (see |apt-Delete()|). The function
	Delete() will remove all files in the output directory (see
	|atp-b:atp_OutDir|), which ends with an extension defined in the list
	|atp-g:atp_tex_extensions|. If you set:
>
	let g:rmcommand=''
<
	then the function Delete() (see |apt-Delete()|) will use the Vim
	|delete()| command, and will delete only the files produced by the
	current '.tex' file. The temporary directory is cleared by rm command.

	The program 'perltrash' is in the package app-misc/perltrash (at least
	for Gentoo).

let g:atp_delete_output=0
	If set to 1 then Delete function (map <F6>d) will delete also the
	output file.	

							*atp-g:atp_tex_extensions*	
let g:atp_tex_extensions=["aux", "log", "bbl", "blg", "spl", "snm", "nav", "thm", "brf", "out", "toc", "mpx", "idx", "maf", "blg", "glo", "mtc[0-9]", "mtc1[0-9]", "pdfsync" , "ind"]	
	 This list is used by the function Delete() (see |apt-Delete()|) which
	 deletes all the files with the specified extension in the directory
	 b:atp_OutDir, unless g:rmcommand="" (see |atp-g:rmcommand|) in which case
	 Delete() deletes only the output files for the current buffer.
									
let g:keep=["log", "aux", "toc", "bbl", "ind"]		*atp-g:keep*
	Files with an extension belonging to this list will be copied from
	'b:atp_OutDir' to the temporary directory with appropriate name. Then it
	will be used by (La)TeX. (log file will be copied after it is created,
	other files will be copied back and forth between 'b:atp_OutDir' and the
	temporary directory). These four elements: log,aux,toc,bbl are
	essentially minimum to work with: table of contents, pdf-bookmarks and
	bibtex. There are possibly other classes, like beamer, or packages
	like theorem (produce .thm files) which will need to configure this
	variable.

	You can change this variable by the command:
		:let g:keep+=["thm","spl"]
								
let g:printeroptions=""					*atp-g:printeroptions*
	You can set the printer options. These are options for the 'lpr'
	command, which will print the output file (pdf or dvi) this depends on
	the b:atp_TexCompiler that you use.

g:texcommand						*atp-g:texcommand*
	This variable is for debugging purposes. It stores the last executed command to
	compile your document. It changes also when your compiler was run
	automatically. >
		:TEX
		:echo g:texcommand
		:TEX 2
		:echo g:texcommand

let t:toc_window_width=30
	g:toc_window_width (by default not set, if set overrides

	Configures the initial width of the window with table of contents.

let t:labels_window_width=30
	g:labels_window_width (by default not set, if set overrides
	t:labels_window_width)
	Configures the initial width of the window with labels.

	by default it is not set, put the line
>
	let g:atp_statusline=0
<
	in your $VIMRC file if you do not want the status line provided by this
	plugin. (See |atp-:ATPStatus|).

let b:atp_TruncateStatuSection=40
	This variable sets how many characters of the section/subsection title
	(or chapter/section titles if you write a book) should be shown in the
	status line.  Section title and subsection title gets equal amount of
	characters.

g:atp_kpsewhich_tex	
g:atp_raw_kpsewhich_tex
	This two variables stores the information returned by 
	    'kpsewhich -show-path tex'
	They are locked. The first one has pretended '**' wildcards to every
	directory, which is done for using with globpath() and findfile()
	functions.

================================================================================
MAPS 		                     			*atp-maps*

Lots of mappings which are given here uses #. This is a convenient map on
British keyboards, but not in the US layout, you can change them for '`' or
some other key that it is not used in Vim (there are not many of them though).
The most commonly used latex-suite plugin uses similar set of mappings (but
there might be some differences). The easy way to change imap leaders is by
using the variables:
>
	    g:atp_imap_first_leader == "#"
	    	for Greak letters,
	    g:atp_imap_second_leader == "##"
	    	for font commands,
	    g:atp_imap_third_leader == "]"
	    	for environments,  
	    g:atp_imap_fourth_leader == "["
	    	for extra environments in the old layout.
<
All other mappings (map, vmap, nmap, ...) are using <LocalLeader> which can be
altered with the option |maplocalleader|. A good alternate solution is to use "_"
instead of "##".

Maps are using the <buffer> option thus are local to the buffer. To unmap you
also have to use this option, for example to unmap \l issue the command:
>
	:unmap <buffer> <LocalLeader>l
<
The maps are loaded unless you set one of variables: 'g:no_plugin_maps' or
'g:no_atp_maps' (disables maps defined in tex_atp.Vim), 'g:no_atp_toc_maps'
(disables maps defined in 'toc_atp.Vim'),  'g:atp_no_env_maps' (disables the
environment maps '[*', ']*') or 'g:atp_no_tab_map' (disables the tab map
for completion, then completion is mapped to <F7> and <S-F7> (for the non
expert mode) but there is no map for 'WrapSelection()', you have to provide 
one by your self).

Note: in all mappings "\" is set to your <LocalLeader> (and thus, in fact, the
map can differ).

	Deletes all the files with an extension which belongs to
	g:atp_tex_extensions in the directory b:atp_OutDir. By default
	g:atp_tex_extensions does not contain '.tex', '.pdf', '.dvi' so none
	of your important files will be deleted. If you set
	g:atp_delete_output=1 the function will delete also the current output
	file (but not any other!).

:TOC
map \t
	This is a mapping to the command ':TOC'

	This is a mapping to the command ':Labels'

TeXdoc:
<F1> 	   
	This is both map and imap. Then you have to type what you are looking
	for and press enter. The option 'keywordprg' is set to 'texdoc -m',
	i.e when your cursor is over a package name and you press 'K' key
	then you should see the package document file (if it is named
	after the package).

	Without any argument it will open "g:atp_TeXdocDefault", by default it
	is eqaul to "-a lshort", i.e. "The not so short introduction to LaTeX
	2e" by Tobias Oetiker. You can change the default for something that
	you use more often, for example you can set it to "-a faq", i.e. 'The
	UK TeX FAQ' (or even to "-a lshort faq" if you want them both :). 

pdffonts is mapped to <F6>g	
There is also a command ':PdfFonts' which does the same.

DEBUGGING						*atp-errors*
 	
This plugins sets the option 
>
	set errorfile=  log file in your b:atp_OutDir directory
<
This allows you to use |quickfix| commands, for example to read the error file
use :cg (see |cg|), to jump to the first error :cf (see |cg|), to list all
errors :cl (see |cl|), read |errorformat| if you want to change the output of
this commands.

								*atp-errors-bibsearch*
A possible error which may occur using the :BibSearch commands has a simple
cause: we count number of brackets '()', '{}' and '"' (but nor '\"') to see
where the bib entry ends and where to join lines. The message error is echoed
when more than 30 lines where processed and the matching bracket was not found
(or the number of '"' is odd). Look at your bib file at the specified
position.  Syntax highlighting for bib files can help you finding where such
an error is located. (After reading the bib file comment lines and lines which
begin with @string are removed, so that the brackets in comment lines do not
count.)

================================================================================
EDITING TOOLS							*atp-editing*

								*atp-visual*
visual mode: ie, iE, ae, im, am, ip, ap, is, as

	They select the current environment in two ways: >
				i 	- inner
				a 	- outer
				e 	- environment 
				p	- paragraph	  
				m	- math zones: \(:\), $:$, \[:\], $$:$$, 
					  or math environment \begin:\end.
				)	- bracket
				s	- syntax
<	ie, iE, ae select environment: from the nearest \begin (top) to the nearest \end (bottom).	

		'viE' selects a bit more than 'vie' but less than 'vae', it
		selects a bracket pair before the beginning of the inner part
		of an environment, so it can be environment name or an option
		just after. 	

	im, am	selects mathematics.

	ip, ap  selects paragraph. 
		In inner mode: from the nearest >
			\begin, \end, \par or empty line (top) 
<		to the nearest >
			\begin, \end, \par or empty line (bottom).
<		in outer mode: from the nearest >
			\par or empty line (top) 
<		to the nearest >
			\par or empty line (bottom).
<				
	is, as	selects using syntax stack (see |synstack()|), inner is the
		top element in the syntax stack (the highlighted area will be
		small) and outer uses the most bottom element in the syntax
		stack (the resulting are will be wide). Some syntax groups are
		filtered out (like 'texDocZone') which not always are
		synchronised.

	

================================================================================
REQUIREMENTS							*atp-requirements*

This plugin requires Vim version higher than 7. 

It is nice to have 'texdoc' program. This plugin maps <F1> to a function which
calls it. This allows to speed up searches for documentation. Also the option
'keywordprg' has the value "texdoc -m", thus pressing 'K' (see |K|) over a tex
package should open you the package documentation. The same applies to this
help file.

Another good programs are texloganalyzer (which is now not used) and pdffonts
There is a map to use pdffonts, see: |pdffonts|.

================================================================================
NOTES ON VIEWERS                               			*atp-viewers*

xpdf								*atp-viewers-xpdf*
	It is fully supported. It is configured in the way that when your tex
	file have errors, xpdf viewer will not reload your file, which I found
	useful. 

	You can set your own options of xpdf using b:XpdfOptions, for example
>
	    let b:atp_xpdfOptions="-bg NavajoWhite4 -fg black -mattecolor burylwood"
<
	will make xpdf view different. This is helpful when you edit to
	files, and do not want to xpdf mix them. Another example:
>
	    let b:atp_xpdfOptions="-bg Grey30 -mattecolor SlateBlue2 -papercolor White"
<
evince
	Works fine.
								*atp-viewers-okular*
okular
	Works fine. Note that okular has supports syncing in pdf. Just use
	'pdfsync' package ('\usepackage{pdfsync}') and set the option in
	okular: >
		settings>Configure Okular>Editor
<	and set >
		Editor		Custom Text Editor
		Command		gvim --servername GVIM --remote-expr "atplib#FindAndOpen('%f','%l')"
<	Then you can use <Shift>+<Left_Mouse> in okular to syncronize the gvim
	with pdf. This syncing is not 100% accurate and you can find on the
	pdfsync web-page that this is not a bug. For me syncing in xdvi works
	better. 
	
	The function atplib#FindAndOpen asks each running gvim server if is is
	"hosting" source of the file %f. Then it uses this server to set the
	line (but it doesn't check if the cursor is in the right window!).

	To do:
	The function 'atplib#FindAndOpen' will not start gvim if it is not
	running.

	Alternative configuration would be to run okular from vim and
	set the Command to >
		Command 	gvim --servername GVIM --remote-wait +%l %f
<	but I don't know how to set this from the command line. If you know,
	Many Thanks for Reporting!


kpdf
	Works fine (moves page a little bit when updates a file).
epdfview
	This viewer does not support automatic reloads when the file changes
	(but it seems that the work is in progress). You have to issue CTRL-R
	yourself when the file is changed.
acroread
	As with epdfview (with the difference that it supports automatic
	updates, but it do not works somehow)
								
xdvi							*atp-viewers-xdvi*
							*atp-viewers-xdvi-reverse/inverse-searching*
	Works fine. The file will be updated after a click (or use the xdvi
	options '-watchfile 1' see man xdvi for explanations). You can set
	inverse/reverse searching by the command |SetXdvi|. It is recommended
	to use gVim rather than Vim, if you want to use Vim you have to run it
	with the command: >
 		vim --servername xdvi <file>
<	You can pick any server name.
	
	The command SetXdvi defines a new function:

RevSearch()							*atp-:RevSearch*
map \rs, :RevSearch
	Which makes an reverse search (sets the xdvi position according to the
	cursor position in gVim).

	Here I describe how inverse/reverse searching is done. 
	
    (1) Inverse searching
	(i.e. position Vim's cursor after xdvi event:
	usually CTRL+Left Mouse) with this options:
>
	    let b:atp_TexCompiler	= "latex"
	    let b:atp_TexOptions	= "-src-specials"
	    let b:atp_Viewer		= "xdvi -editor 'gvim --remote-wait +%l %f'"
<
	See Vim tip at: http://Vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_can_interact_with_xdvi 	

    (2) Reverse searching
	For reverse searching (position xdvi according to the Vim's cursor
	position) you can set:
>
	    let b:reverse_search="xdvi -sourceposition " . line(".") . ":" . col(".") . fnamemodify(expand("%"),":p") . " " . fnamemodify(expand("%"),":p:r") . ".dvi"
<
	To make an reverse search:
>
		:call system(b:reverse_search)
<
	And xdvi will place itself at the current cursor position in the 'tex'
	source file. You can make a map for this. 

	To use this with Vim one have to add server name. Run
	Vim as:
>
	    vim --servername VimTeX
	    let b:atp_Viewer="xdvi -editor 'vim --servername " . v:servername . " --remote-wait +%l %f'"
	    let b:reverse_search="xdvi -editdor 'vim --servername " . v:servername "' -sourceposition " . line(".") . ":" . col(".") . fnamemodify(expand("%"),":p") . " " . fnamemodify(expand("%"),":p:r") . ".dvi"
<
	In case of troubles:

	Reverse Searching:
	    If reverse searching do not works for you, and you get an error, that
	    there is no reference to your tex file in the dvi file, then open
	    your dvi file in an editor (Vim :) and check what is the name after
	    'src:<line number>' (this are the source specials put by 'latex
	    -src-specials' command). It should refer to your tex file. Xdvi
	    will not recognize if you specify the full name of the tex file (i.e.
	    with path) in the b:reverse_search (as we do above using the
	    modifier :p and the function fnamemodify in
	    'fnamemodify(expand("%"),":p")' the other one with ":p:r" is OK!)
	    and in the dvi file there is written just the name without the
	    path (and vice versa, if you give just the name in
	    b:reverse_search and in the file there is full path).
	    
	There is an excellent web pages on inverse/reverse searching with
	xdvi: >
		http://xdvi.sourceforge.net/inverse-search.html
<	'tip': You can put in your atprc file |atp-atprc| file >
		    au BufEnter *.tex :SetXdvi
<	'tip': If you want to change the name of the command this is also
	       possible for example by putting in you atprc file: >
     augroup DelCommands
	 au VimEnter *tex delcommand SetXdvi
	 au VimEnter *tex delcommand SetXpdf
     augroup END
     command! -buffer	Xdvi	:call SetXdvi()
     command! -buffer	Xpdf	:call SetXpdf()

TIPS                               				*atp-tips*

If you have any nice tip on editing (La)TeX with vim or ATP :) you can share it
here (my email you'll find on top of the help file), or put them on the script
web page. 

:g/^[^%]*\\usepackge/#		List loaded packages with line numbers

y/\\begin{document}/		When standing on 1st line - copy the preambule
				(possibly to a register)
:g/^\s*%/d			Delete comment lines 				

:g/\(^\s*\n\)\{2,}/d		Compress empty lines 
					/ when there are more than two empty
					lines it leaves just one /  

vipgq				Format inner paragraph. Or even better:
m`vipgq``			This is so nice that I added a map: >
				    nmap gw	m`vipgq``		
<
m`vip>``			
m`vip<``			Indent inner paragraph, they are mapped to: >
				    nmap g>	m`vip>``
				    nmap g<	m`vip<``
<				There are also defined maps: 2g>, 3g> , 4g>
				up to 6g>.

:TeXdoc ams<Ctrl-d>		Show tex documentation which matches ams (the
				completion for TeXdoc command finds matches in
				alias files of texdoc :!texdoc -f).
\ref{^thm:<Tab>			will list all cross references to theorems (if
				you use the prefix thm: for theorems.

				If you want to change the name of a command,
				you can try:
augroup DelCommands
    au VimEnter *tex delcommand SetXdvi
    au VimEnter *tex delcommand SetXpdf
augroup END
command! -buffer	Xdvi	:call SetXdvi()
command! -buffer	Xpdf	:call SetXpdf()

				However, not all functions are defined without
				<SID> (you can always try to reach me).

:'<,'>WrapSelection @q		Wrap a visual area with wrapper from the
				register q and with the default '}' end
				wrapper.
:'<,'>WrapSelection @q,@w	As above but with the end wrapper from
				register w. 

:map ]=		]sz=		Goto the first spelling error and list 
:map [=		[sz=		suggestions. Another version is to use
				]S and [S instead of ]s and [s.
				

================================================================================
COLOUR HIGHLIGHTING AND SYNTAX GROUPS				*atp-highlight*

When the cursor is positioned on \begin{envname} or \end{envname} both
corresponding \begin:\end get highlighted with syntax group MatchParen. 
To disable it type this in ex mode or put it in your atprc file: >
	augroup LatexBox_HighlightPairs 
	     au!
	augroup END
<

There is a color scheme included: coots-beauty-256. You need 256 colors to use
it (in the terminal). 

These are the highlights groups defined for various files and the default
links:

1) ToC file >
	highlight atp_FileName		Title
	highlight atp_LineNr		LineNr
	highlight atp_Number		Number
	highlight atp_Chapter		Label
	highlight atp_Section		Label
	highlight atp_SubSection	Label
	highlight atp_Abstract		Label
<		*this group highlights abstract and all the unnubered chapters
		 and the bibliography.

    The chapter group highlights or chapters, or sections, or parts, depending
    what is your top level section in your latex document. This applies,
    accordingly, to other groups.

2) Labels file >
	highlight atp_label_FileName	Title
	highlight atp_label_LineNr	LineNr
	highlight atp_label_Name 	Label
	highlight atp_label_Counter 	Keyword
<
3) BibSearch file
    this is very much the same as the standard syntax for bib files. Groups
    are named bibsearch<NAME> instead of bib<NAME>. There is one more group
    added:
>
	highlight bibsearchInfo
<
    which highlights the line number of the bib entry in the bib file.  All
    bibsearch groups are by default linked to the bib groups.

    Yet, there is no default highlighting, try coots-beauty-256 color scheme.
    If you like it, I'm glad, if you have a nice (non standard) color scheme,
    I'm happy to get it, if you like to share it.

4) Status line:
    The notification message that your compiler is running can be highlighted.
    For this set the variables: >
    	g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_gui
    	g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_guifg
    	g:atp_notification_{g:colors_name}_guibg
<   Their values will be passed to gui guifg and guibg values of the highlight
    command. The g:colors_name variable is set by color scheme. Usually it is
    just the color scheme name but there might be a difference, for example:
    the provided color scheme file name is 'coots-beauty-256' but the variable
    is set to 'coots_beauty_256'. Example: >
    	let g:atp_notification_coots_beauty_256_gui="DeepPink4"
<   will set the foreground color of 'pdfLaTeX' message to DeepPink4.


================================================================================
FINAL REMARKS                               			*atp-remarks*
	
	To see some messages that are issued you can use :messages command
	(see |:mes|).

	If you find this plugin useful and have some comments you are
	cordially invited to write to the author: <mszamot@gmail.com>.

	There are other ways to make such an automatic plugin. The crucial
	step is to make the plugin know that tex is already in use (if you run
	to tex compilers on the same file at the same time the effect won't be
	good).

	For several month I was using a different code which was not using
	temporary copies but was checking if the tex is running or not. It was
	working very good but I didn't understand why (silly isn't it), and
	when I started making changes it stopped working: the issue is that
	it is difficult to make a function sleep until tex stops working not
	putting whole Vim into sleep - this is the time that we want to save.
	However, the advantage of using temporary files is smoothness (changes
	appear faster in the output file). 

	Best regards, and hopefully you will find this useful :) 
	Marcin Szamotulski
