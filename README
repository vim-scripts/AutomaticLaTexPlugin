The ######PLUGIN LAYOUT CHANGES####### in version __10.6__ (__AGAIN__). You should __UNINSTALL ATP__ before installing new version (remove all the files, what is easy if you used VimBall to install it (now useing :RmVimball command). You can always install vimball (ver. < 10.5 or ver 10.5 if this was your previous version) and then uninstall it with :RmVimball. In this way all the files (but not the directories) will be removed.
